# Implementation Plan

Once this specification is settled, the target of Phase A is determined.

1. **Define the Core AST** ([Kinds and Types](../03-Typed-Core/01-Kinds-and-Types.md), [Terms and Matching](../03-Typed-Core/04-Terms-and-Matching.md), [Modules](../06-Modules/01-Modules.md))
2. **Row normalization `nf`, the entailment decision `Γ ⊨ C`, and row unification** ([Rows](../03-Typed-Core/02-Rows.md), [Elaboration](../02-Surface-Language/01-Elaboration.md)) — the first target for unit tests and property tests
3. **The Core type checker** ([Core Type Checker](../03-Typed-Core/07-Core-Type-Checker.md))
4. **Hand-write the Core module of the vertical slice** ([Examples](../03-Typed-Core/08-Examples.md)) and run it through step 3 — the type checker's first end-to-end test
5. **Lowering to Mid IR**: the erasures of [Semantics](../03-Typed-Core/06-Semantics.md), and the mapping of decision trees and join points
6. **The JavaScript backend**
7. **Parser, name resolution, type inference, and elaboration**, built on top of steps 1 through 4

Steps 2 and 4 precede step 7 because the type checker can run before the parser exists. Being able to write Core by hand is also what demonstrates in practice that Core type checking is self-contained.

## Notes on step 2

Row unification is where subtle errors concentrate, and two properties deserve explicit regression tests.

**Two-sided refinement.** A constraint such as `{ a : A | ?r } ≡ { b : B | ?s }` cannot be solved by substituting into one side; it requires a fresh variable substituted into both. A one-sided substitution either produces an incorrect solution or fails an occurs check and rejects a solvable constraint.

**The rigid/flexible distinction.** A rigid row variable is not assignable but can be absorbed by a flexible tail on the other side. Case analysis that only checks whether a tail is empty gets this wrong.

## Notes on step 5

Two constraints must be respected even though the constructs they concern belong to Phase E.

**Do not assume one-shot continuations** in Mid IR's representation ([Semantics](../03-Typed-Core/06-Semantics.md)). Mid IR is designed in Phase A while effect lowering belongs to Phase E, so the assumption would be baked in before the decision is made.

**Represent partially applied constructors** ([Semantics](../03-Typed-Core/06-Semantics.md)). A constructor application with fewer arguments than its arity is a value and may be passed around. Mid IR should retain constructor application in a form that lowers either to curried functions or to a partial-application object.

**The bytecode and the virtual machine belong to this step**, between it and step 6. Lowering Mid IR to a `.dmo` and executing one is what makes a program runnable before either web backend exists. See [Mid IR](../04-MiddleEnd/01-Mid-IR.md), [Translation](../04-MiddleEnd/02-Translation.md), and [Bytecode](../05-Backend/01-Bytecode.md).

**The machine does not replace the Core evaluator.** Preservation reduces a Typed Core term one step and re-runs the type checker; erasure compares the typed relation against the erased one. A machine state carries no types, so it serves neither — there is nothing to type check, and no typed side to compare against. The Core evaluator of step 4 is what those two properties are tested against, and it stays.

What the machine adds is of two kinds. It is a **second evaluator to compare against**: one program run both ways should give the same value and the same sequence of observable effects, which tests the whole of translation and lowering at once and is what catches a fold that reorders effects or drops one. And it **runs programs the web backends cannot**, a second resumption of a continuation among them (D33), so effect safety and progress can be exercised on terms that D18's gap otherwise puts out of reach.

Anything stronger — asserting preservation over machine states — would need a correspondence between a machine state and the Core term it stands for, and nothing defines one.

## Notes on step 6

The set of FFI the backend must implement is `dawn-base-0.1`, the first version of the `Base` ABI surface ([Open Questions](../07-Open-Questions/01-Open-Questions.md)). The longer it is deferred, the more the standard library settles into a shape that depends on FFI, so it should be fixed while writing this backend.

## Testing the properties instead of proving them

[Semantics](../03-Typed-Core/06-Semantics.md) states progress, preservation, effect safety, and erasure without proof. Proving them for a calculus with rows, effect rows, and handlers is a substantial undertaking, and most of the confidence it would buy is available more cheaply: **each property can be turned into a property test.**

This requires a Core evaluator, which step 4 needs regardless. Type checking a hand-written module confirms that it is well typed; running it is what confirms that it computes.

**Preservation** is the most directly testable. Generate a well-typed Core term, reduce one step, and re-run the type checker.

```text
assume Σ ⊨ G
for each generated e with ·;· ⊢ e : τ ! ρ:
    while e is not a value and fuel remains:
        c = step(G, e)
        if c is a fault:  stop; the run ends, and nothing is asserted
        assert ·;· ⊢ c : τ ! ρ
        e = c
```

A step to a fault ends the run rather than failing the test: a fault carries no type, so there is nothing to re-check.

Both the type and the ambient row are checked for equality. A generator that produces `G` must satisfy `Σ ⊨ G`; supplying an ill-typed global definition or a non-conforming `δ_f` invalidates the property rather than testing it.

The type checker is already required for step 3, so the assertion costs nothing to write. What takes work is the generator: producing well-typed terms rather than arbitrary ones. Generating type-directed — choosing a type first, then building a term of it — is the practical approach, and it doubles as a source of test cases for the checker itself.

**Progress** falls out of the same loop: if `e` is not a value and `step` returns nothing, the property has failed.

**Erasure** is a differential test. Run a term under the typed relation and its erasure under the erased relation, and compare the sequences of observable steps; a typed step that only consumes a coercion corresponds to no erased step.

**Effect safety** deserves separate treatment, because it is the property that ordinary tests are least likely to reveal: a violation does not crash, it silently performs an effect.

The test is **not** to reject every `perform`. A term well typed at ambient row `()` may perform operations internally, so long as each is enclosed by a handler for its key; rejecting them outright would fail correct programs. What the evaluator maintains instead is a stack of installed handler keys, and it asserts that **every `perform` it executes finds a handler on that stack**. Reaching a `perform` with no matching handler is the failure.

Generating terms that call effectful functions and wrap them in handlers is what exercises the property; what is being checked is that the wrapping is genuinely exhaustive.

Extending the generator to `foreign` declarations is worthwhile once the FFI surface exists, since D23 together with condition (3) of `Σ ⊨ G` is what keeps effect safety from being violated at that boundary. D23 alone constrains only the declared type.

**Machine-checked or paper proofs are deferred.** They become worth revisiting if the work is to be published, or if one subsystem keeps producing subtle bugs that property testing does not catch.

**Conformance of the global environment** is a premise of every property above, not something they establish. A test harness supplies `G` and must therefore guarantee `Σ ⊨ G` itself: global definitions are well-typed values, and each `δ_f` returns either a value of the instantiated result type — the one the spine judgement gives — or a permitted fault, performs nothing observable to Core, and terminates.

For generated `foreign` declarations this is easy, since the harness writes `δ_f` and can make it a pure total function that never faults. For real backends it is a conformance obligation, and a backend test suite should check it directly rather than relying on the property tests above to expose a violation.

## A catalogue of regression tests

Each entry below is a case in which a plausible implementation gives the wrong answer. They are worth writing as tests before the corresponding code rather than after, since property testing reaches most of them only by chance: several require a specific combination of features to arise at all.

The heading of each group names the step of the plan that the group belongs to.

### Row normalization and unification (step 2)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `{ a : A \| ?r } ≡ { b : B \| ?s }` | Solved with a fresh `?t`: `?r := ( b : B \| ?t )` and `?s := ( a : A \| ?t )`. Substituting into one side alone either yields an unequal pair or fails an occurs check on the symmetric attempt |
| `forall (r : Row Type). Record r ≡ Record ( name : String )` | Fails. A rigid tail cannot absorb a known field |
| `?s ≡ ( a : A \| r )` with `r` rigid | Succeeds. A rigid tail **can** be absorbed by a flexible one on the other side |
| `( name : String \| r ) ≡ ( name : String \| s )`, `r` and `s` distinct rigid variables | Fails. Distinct row variables are not identified |
| `⟨∅;{r,s}⟩ ≡ ⟨∅;{s,r}⟩` | Succeeds. The tail is a set |
| `⟨∅;{?r,?s}⟩ ≡ ⟨{a↦A};∅⟩` | Stuck, not failure. Two solutions exist, so the constraint waits |
| A solved `?r := D ⊎ ?t` where `k ∉ ?r` was assumed | The Lacks constraint propagates to `?t`, and `k ∉ dom(D)` is checked. Omitting this produces Core that is not well-kinded |
| `r ⊎ r` | Ill-kinded. The disjointness side condition rejects it before normalization |

### Kinds and constraints (step 3)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `forall (e : Effect). …` | Rejected. `Effect` is not a quantifiable kind |
| `forall (f : Type -> Effect). …` | Rejected, for the same reason |
| `Proxy [[Effect]]` | Rejected. Instantiation also requires a quantifiable kind |
| `forall (f : Type -> Type). …` | **Accepted.** Higher-kinded types must survive the restriction |
| `forall (r : Row Effect). …` | Accepted |
| `Row (Type -> Type)` | Ill-formed. `Row` takes only a row element kind |
| `#Ok ∉ ( Console )` | Rejected. A tag is not a key of a `Row Effect`; a `SymbolKey` would be admitted, since it may key a labelled instance |
| `ρ1 # ρ2` with `ρ1 : Row Type` and `ρ2 : Row Effect` | Rejected. Both sides share one row element kind |
| `Proxy [[Type]] [Int]` and `Proxy [[Row Type]] [( x : Int )]` | Both accepted. Type and data constructors carry independent kind schemes |
| `forall (f : Row Type -> Type). …` | Accepted. A row may be consumed |
| `forall (f : Row Type -> Row Type). …` | Rejected. Only row syntax produces a row, which is what keeps `nf` total on well-kinded rows |
| `forall (f : Type -> k). …` | Rejected. `k` may be instantiated with a row kind |
| A `Σ` entry `MkRow : Type -> Row Type`, used as `Record (MkRow Int)` | Rejected at the occurrence. Kinding does not trust the table for this |
| `(name ∉ r) => Record ( name : String \| r )` | **Accepted.** The constraint is assumed while the body is kinded; without it the row is not sharp |
| `(name ∉ ( name : String )) => Int` | Rejected. `Γ, C` requires `C` to be satisfiable |

### Row keys (step 3)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `( SymbolKey X : Int, TagKey X : Int )` | **Accepted.** The two are different keys; sharing a spelling does not make them collide |
| `( cache : State Int, counter : State Int )` | **Accepted.** One effect, two elements, distinguished by their keys |
| `( cache : State Int, cache : State String )` | Rejected. The same key twice, whatever the payloads |
| `( State Int, State String )` | Rejected. Both derive `EffectKey State` |
| `( PositionKey (-1) : Int )` | Rejected. The grammar gives `PositionKey` a `Nat`, and the AST holds an `Int`, so the bound is a kinding side condition |
| `( EffectKey State : Int )` | Rejected. `Γ ⊢ k key Type` admits the structural keys only |
| A handler keyed `cache` enclosing `perform counter.get` | The `perform` passes through. `Ev_k` matches on the key, and `counter` is not `cache` |
| `perform cache.get` where the row has `cache ↦ State Int` | The operation's type comes from `Σ(State)`, not from `cache`. A checker that looked the key up in `Σ` would fail here and pass on the unlabelled form |
| `handle (handle e with h) with h` at one key | Rejected. The inner one would stand at `( k \| ( k \| ρ ) )`, which is not sharp |
| A pure function handling `E` within itself, called through `openEff [( E )]` under an outer handler of `E` | **Accepted.** No row carries `E` twice; the two handlers meet only in the run-time stack |

### Decision trees and handlers (step 3)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `switchCtor` with no default, not exhausting the constructors | Rejected |
| `switchLit` with no default | Rejected. A default is mandatory |
| `switchKey` over a closed variant enumerating only some keys, no default | Rejected. A value would be left with no destination |
| `switchKey` over a row with an unknown tail, no default | Rejected |
| `switchCtor` with a default whose body is ill-typed | Rejected. The default branch is typed like any other |
| `switchKey` default | The occurrence is refined to the residual `Variant r'`, not left at the original type |
| A handler omitting an operation of `E` | Rejected. `handle` removes the keyed element, so an operation without a clause has nowhere to go |
| A handler clause that does not respect an operation's own `forall b̄` | Rejected |
| An interpreter sequencing a native action before resuming a continuation, the residual row not being closed | Rejected. That continuation is `a -{ρ}-> IO r`, which the pure arrow of `Base.IO.bind` does not take. Abandoning the continuation, or resuming it first, is admitted |
| A pure global applied where the ambient row is not empty, as `Base.Int.add n 1` is under `( State Int | e )` | Rejected without `openEff`. An application requires the arrow to carry the ambient row and containment is never inserted (D8); currying makes it one `openEff` per argument consumed |
| A data constructor applied in a handler clause, the row outside the handle not being empty | Rejected for the same reason. Constructor arrows are pure by declaration, so one is widened like any other pure global. An instantiation such as `Prelude.Nothing [a]` needs no widening, applying nothing |
| `handle (perform E.op v) with h` at ambient row `()` | **Accepted.** Effect safety is not "no operation is performed" |
| A `λ` whose body jumps to a join point bound outside it | Rejected. The join point context is discarded at a lambda |
| A `letjoin` in argument position whose definition jumps to itself | Accepted. The root of a definition is in tail position wherever the `letjoin` stands |
| `switchCtor` whose first branch reaches no leaf and whose second does | Accepted, at the type the second gives. The written order of branches carries no meaning |
| `bind x = o . k` with no dispatch having established `o . k` | Accepted. A record has an element at every key of its row |
| A handler clause whose continuation is typed at the inner row | Rejected. It is `τ' -{ρ}-> β`, the row outside the handle and the result of it (D15) |
| A clause binding `forall b` where the operation declares `forall a` | Accepted. The binders are aligned, a handler respecting the polymorphism rather than the spelling |
| A clause binding a different number of them, or one at another kind | Rejected |
| A `full` clause's body | Checked at the answer type `β`. It is the clause that supplies what the `handle` returns |
| A `fast` clause's body | Checked at the resume type `τ_i'`. `β` appears nowhere in its premise (D28) |
| A `fast` clause whose body has the answer type instead | Rejected by that check |
| A `fast` clause carrying a continuation binder | Not representable. The forms are separate, so no clause has an optional one and no marker is absent |
| A handler mixing a `full` clause with a `fast` one | Accepted. The form is written per clause |
| `fast abort1 [b] (_ : Unit) -> perform Abort2.abort2 [b] Prim.Unit` | Accepted. A polymorphic resume type rules out a pure terminating body, not a translation into another effect |
| The handler interpreting `Partial` into `Maybe` | `full`. Its answer is `Maybe a` where the computation's is `a`, and only a `full` clause supplies an answer |
| `guard` whose consequent reaches no leaf and whose alternative does | Accepted, at the type the alternative gives |

### FFI and declarations (step 3)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `foreign log : String -{( Console )}-> Unit` | Rejected. An effectful result arrow would let the effect bypass a handler |
| `foreign mapImpl : ( a -{e}-> b ) -> …` | Rejected. An effectful argument arrow would leak the calling convention across the boundary |
| `foreign Js.Console.log : String -> IO Unit` | Accepted. This is the shape every real-world leaf takes |
| `foreign use : Record ( cb : Int -{( Console )}-> Int ) -> Unit` | Rejected. An arrow reaches the boundary through the payload of a row as readily as through an argument |
| A `foreign` whose only effectful arrow stands inside a constraint | Accepted. A constraint is an erased proposition and carries no value across the boundary |
| An effect with an operation `liftIO : forall a. IO a ->* a` | **Accepted.** `perform` carries the opaque `IO` to the handler without executing it. What it costs is the granularity of the capability, not soundness |
| `newtype` on a type with two constructors, or with one constructor of two fields | Rejected. The backend erases the representation on the strength of this flag |
| A `nonrec` whose right-hand side refers to a `foreign` declared later in the text | Initializes. Constructors and foreign implementations enter the environment before any value declaration is evaluated |
| A `nonrec` referring to a later `nonrec` | Rejected. Value declarations are in dependency order |
| A top-level `rec` group whose members have different kind schemes | Accepted. Every scheme is registered before any right-hand side is checked |
| A `Σ` entry `T : forall k. k` | Rejected where the signature is built. Every use site instantiating it at `Type` would pass, so an occurrence check alone lets it in |
| A `Σ` entry `T : k -> Type` with nothing binding `k`, or `T : Effect -> Type` | Rejected there too. The whole scheme is checked under the kind variables it binds, not only its result |
| One entry reaching a name through two import paths | Accepted. A name belongs to the module that declares it, so the two are one entry |
| Two different entries under one name | Rejected where the parts are merged, rather than resolved by preferring either |
| A data constructor and a value of one name | Rejected. A constructor is an ordinary global name, so the two share a namespace |

### Reduction (step 4, once an evaluator exists)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `let x = (openEff [( E )] f) 0 in perform E.op Prim.Unit` with `f : Int -> Int` | Steps to `let x = openEffC [( E )] (f 0) in …`. Discarding the coercion leaves the two parts of the `let` with no common ambient row |
| `id [Int -> Int] f 0` with `foreign id : forall a. a -> a` | `δ_id(f)` runs and returns `f`, and `0` is applied to the result. Testing the substituted type instead absorbs `0` and calls `δ_id(f, 0)` |
| `foreign clock : IO Time`, an arity-zero foreign | Steps to `δ_clock()`. The spine is saturated as soon as it is formed |
| `M.f v` for a unary foreign | Steps. The final value argument must fire the implementation |
| `Base.IO.pure [Int]` | Steps. A polymorphic foreign accumulates the type argument on its spine |
| `letjoin j (x : Int) : Int = e1 in let y = (λz.z) 1 in jump j y` | The body reduces before the jump fires |
| `letrec { f = λx. … } in e` | Unfolds only in elimination position. No term steps to itself |
| `switchKey` on a value wrapped in `weaken` | Dispatches on the key actually injected. `weaken` is a value form and is looked through |
| `bind x = o in guard (p x) …` | The substitution happens before descending, so the guard's condition has no free `x` |
| That call, once it is evaluated | The innermost handler of the key is chosen: `Ev_k` lets no `handle` of that key stand between it and the hole |
| `handle Ev_k[perform k.op v] with h` whose clause for `op` is `fast` | The body takes the place of the `perform` inside `Ev_k` with the handler still installed, and no continuation value is built. `openEffC [( ent )]` preserves the type and the ambient row exactly, and is discharged against the value the body produces |
| A saturated foreign whose `δ_f` faults | Steps to `fault φ`, which propagates out of every context including `handle`. It is not caught by a handler and is not the `Partial` effect |
| A term at ambient row `()` reaching a `perform` with no enclosing handler | Does not arise. This is what effect safety asserts |

### Erasure (step 5)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| A term and its erasure | The same sequence of observable steps, modulo steps that only introduce or discharge a coercion |
| A term whose reduction faults | The erased term faults identically |
| The number of run-time arguments a backend passes to `δ_f` | Determined by the arrow count of the **declared** type, not by the instantiated result type |
| A handler carrying a `full` clause and a `fast` clause | Both markers survive erasure, Core having written each of them. They carry no type information, and a backend lowers the two differently |

### Translation to Mid IR (step 5)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| A saturated call to a pure global under a non-empty ambient row, wrapped in one `openEff` per argument consumed | One `callk`. Peeling the spine looks through `openEff`, `TyApp`, and `ConstraintApp`; stopping at the first of them emits a chain of `callu`s where one known call belongs |
| `Main.Nil [Int]` | The atom `const Main.Nil`. A saturated constructor of arity 0 allocates nothing |
| A `foreign` of arity 0, referenced bare | `ffi f []`, which **calls the implementation**. The spine is saturated as soon as it is formed, so treating the reference as a value leaves the call unmade |
| A `foreign` of arity `n > 0`, referenced bare | `pap f []`. It is a value, not a call and not an atom |
| A top-level value referenced bare | The atom `global M.x`, which is a load |
| A constructor applied below its arity | `pap`. Over-application does not arise, a constructor's declared result never being an arrow |
| A global whose definitional arity the interface does not publish | `callu`. Correct for every callee; arity buys `callk` and never correctness |
| `o ! Ctor . j` | Materialized inside the branch that selected `Ctor`, and nowhere earlier. Projecting it before the dispatch reads a field that is not there |
| One occurrence used by several nodes | Projected once. An occurrence has no effect, so naming it once is sound |
| A `Case` in argument position | A join point binding the continuation, not the continuation duplicated into each branch. A `Handle` needs none of this, being a computation |
| A `Bind` of an occurrence already materialized | An alias in the translator's environment; no instruction is emitted |
| A handler clause body | A function with an explicit capture list. No join point of the enclosing scope is in scope in it, nor in the body of the `handle` |
| A member of a top-level `rec` group | A closure over an **empty** capture list. Its recursive references are global names, so nothing is evaluated to install it |
| A `nonrec` whose right-hand side diverges, referred to by nothing | Initialization hangs. Evaluation is eager and in declaration order |
| A binding whose Core type is a type variable | `Rep Val`. Sound wherever a type is not to hand, and the cost is precision |
| `f (perform A.x Prim.Unit) (perform B.y Prim.Unit)` | `B.y` is performed first. An application evaluates its argument before its function, so a spine runs right to left (D35) |
| A spine folded into one call, against the same spine as nested applications | The same sequence of observable effects and the same faults, in the same order. This is what makes folding sound and is worth a generated test rather than a written one |
| A global of definitional arity 1 applied to two arguments | `callk` with the first, then `callu` with the second. Both arguments are evaluated before either call, and whatever `f x` performs happens between the two calls |
| `nonrec alias = Main.f` | Arity **absent**, not 0. What it stores is a function of `Main.f`'s arity, so reading 0 makes every call to `alias` an over-application of a nullary function |
| `λx. λy. e` | **One** function table entry of two parameters, so that the entry's arity and the definitional arity agree. Two entries of one parameter each would have `callk f [a, b]` supply two arguments to a function of one |
| `Λa. λx. Λb. λy. e` | The same entry of two parameters. The run of lambdas is taken after erasure, so a type abstraction between two of them does not break it |
| A `Handle` whose value is consumed by a surrounding expression | A `let` binding a `handle` computation. Its body is a function, so the return clause — entered later, and a function itself — has an ordinary call's result to give back rather than a join point it cannot reach |
| `update k e1 e2` where both operands are computations | `e1`, the **record**, is evaluated and passed first. `extend` takes them the other way about, so a translation reading one convention for both reverses the effects of the two operands |
| A right-hand side that is a lambda under `openEff`, `[τ]`, or `[•]` | Its definitional arity is the lambda's. A run of lambdas is taken after erasure, so stopping at a wrapper reads the definition as taking no argument and degrades every call to it to `callu` |
| The locals of two functions | Numbered from zero in each. A `Local` is unique within a function and not beyond one, so numbering across the module would leave a backend renaming before it could use one as a frame slot |
| The `source` of a lifted function | The annotation of the term the function was made from, wrappers included — not that of the body left once the lambdas come off, and not that of the lambda left once the wrappers come off. A lambda annotated 10 over a body annotated 11 records 10; an `openEff` annotated 30 over that lambda records 30 |
| Where the wrappers erasure removes are looked through | Dispatch reads what erasure leaves; the node as it stands is what supplies the type and the annotation. Recursing into the inner term instead loses the span of the whole and narrows the type a `[τ]` had settled |
| `weaken k [τ] (f x)` | One `callk`. Peeling a spine looks through **every** wrapper erasure removes, not only the four that can wrap a function: a peel stopping at `weaken` returns the term it was given with no argument taken off, and naming that head reaches the same term again |
| `let z = y in …`, where `y` is already a local | No local is created and the debug table is untouched. Recording `z` against `y`'s local would rename `y` |
| A local holding a projection, or an intermediate result of a folded spine | Named nowhere. It was created for no name |

### Lowering to bytecode (step 5)

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| A branch of a `BRC` | A `Node` held inline. A decision tree stays a tree, so a branch is not an edge to a block elsewhere (D32) |
| A `jump` | A `JMP` naming the join point. Never an offset |
| Two branches that cannot both run | Distinct register slots. There is no register allocation, so slots are not shared |
| An atom that is a literal | `LOADK` into a slot of its own before the instruction that takes it |
| A Mid IR `tail` of a `ctor` or a `closure` | That instruction followed by `RET`. Only a call has a `Tail` of its own |
| A group of mutually capturing closures | `CLOSN` for every member before any `SETCAP`. Filling one capture list first reads a closure that does not exist yet |
| A continuation applied twice | Two independent runs, each resuming from the state that was captured, so that what the first did does not reach the second. Each application returns to the `CALLU` that made it rather than to the `HNDL` that installed the handler (D33) |
| A `fast` clause | No continuation value is constructed, and the continuation is not split |
| `perform` under two handlers of one key | The innermost. Handlers of one key nest at run time, `openEff` being what puts a self-handling function under an outer one |
| A faulting `FFI` inside a `handle` | The whole continuation is discarded, handler markers included. A fault is not the `Partial` effect and no clause sees it |
| A `JMP` read from a file | The destination's parameter registers come from the `Join`, which names them. A count alone leaves a consumer unable to perform the transfer |
| A tail call in the body of a `handle` | The marker and the path to the return clause survive it. The marker stands below the body's activation, which is the one a tail call replaces |
| `RET` at the end of a `handle` body | The return clause runs and its own value goes to the `HNDL`. `RET` itself has no case for a handler; where the marker stands is what produces this |
| `isNewtype` on a constructor | Carried from Core through Mid IR into `CTORS`. A `newtype` and a data type of one constructor with one field have the same shape, so a backend erasing the representation cannot tell them apart without the flag |

### Handler declarations and implicit insertion (step 7)

These belong with elaboration and are written once a surface language exists ([Effect Handlers](../02-Surface-Language/02-Effect-Handlers.md)).

| Input | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `handler h : E ~> ρ where …` | Desugars to a value declaration whose scheme is effect-polymorphic and whose source row holds the target beside `E`. The narrower source row does not compose |
| A clause written with neither marker | Desugars to `full`. Core has no unmarked form to fall back on (D28) |
| A handler declaration with a `return` clause and an answer type of its own | Accepted, written with a full signature rather than `~>` |
| `implicit` on a handler with a `full` clause, a `return` clause, or a value parameter | Rejected where it is declared |
| An expression at `a ! ( Console \| e )` inferred, with no expected row | No insertion. Inference gives an expression its own least row |
| The same expression checked against `a ! ( LiftIO \| e )`, one implicit handler for `Console` | The handler is applied to a thunk of it, under one `openEff`. What reaches Core is application, `openEff`, and `handle`, and nothing else |
| `ρ1 ≡ ρ2` solvable by instantiating a metavariable | Solved by unification. Insertion is attempted only on a definite failure |
| `( Console \| ?e )` checked against `( LiftIO \| ?e )` | Accepted. The shared flexible tail cancels first, leaving a settled key difference. Waiting on it would stall the ordinary case |
| A flexible tail surviving the cancellation of shared tails | Stuck on the metavariables awaited, in the queue synthesis goals use. Not a failure |
| A rigid tail shared by both rows | Not a reason to wait. It cancels, and nothing in the goal can assign it a key |
| A computation already performing the target, `( Console, LiftIO \| e )` checked against `( LiftIO \| e )` | Accepted, and widened by nothing. Adding an element the row already carries is not well-kinded |
| A key carried only by the expected row, with an empty plan | Accepted. Step 4 widens, and the term is the widened thunk forced at once rather than a nest of applications |
| A key on both sides whose payloads differ | Failure. A widening adds elements and reconciles no payload |
| One key contributed to `W` twice with different payloads, by two targets or by a target and the expected row | Failure where `W` is formed. It is a union of finite maps and is partial |
| `{ Console, File }` checked against `{ LiftIO }`, with an implicit handler for each | Ambiguity. The dependency relation orders neither, so the plan is not unique (D29) |
| `{ Console }` checked against `{ LiftIO }` through `Console ~> Logging` and `Logging ~> LiftIO` | Accepted. The order is unique under the **transitive closure**, which the direct edges alone do not make total for a chain of three |
| Two handlers nested by one plan | The inner result is thunked again before the outer receives it, a handler taking a thunk and returning a computation |
| A plan of no handlers at all | The term is `q0 Prim.Unit`, the widened thunk forced. A rule written as a nest of applications has no term here |
| Two implicit handlers for one key | Ambiguity, naming both and the modules they come from |
| Implicit declarations forming a cycle across two modules | Rejected where `Ξ` is assembled from the imports. Neither declaration is wrong on its own, so checking one at a time does not see it |
| An implicit handler for a labelled instance's key | Out of scope for v0.1, `Ξ` being keyed and the spelling of labelled instances unsettled |
