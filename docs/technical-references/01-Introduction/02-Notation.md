# Notation

This document lists the notation used throughout the Stella design documents.
Notation confined to a single document is introduced where it is used.

## Metavariables

| Symbol | Ranges over |
| --- | --- |
| `k` | kind variables |
| `κ` | kinds |
| `ε` | row element kinds (`Type` or `Effect`) |
| `q` | quantifiable kinds |
| `a`, `b` | type variables |
| `τ`, `σ` | types |
| `ρ`, `r`, `s`, `e` | rows (`e` usually an effect row) |
| `ς` | an argument spine of a constructor or foreign |
| `α` | a spine argument: `[τ]`, `[•]`, or a value |
| `θ` | a kind and type substitution |
| `δ_f` | the implementation of a foreign `f` |
| `ω` | the payload of an opaque value, held by the backend |
| `k` | row keys |
| `s` | the symbol of a `SymbolKey` |
| `T` | type constructors |
| `Ctor` | data constructors |
| `E` | effect constructors |
| `x`, `y` | value variables |
| `j` | join points |
| `o` | occurrences |
| `C` | constraints |
| `Σ`, `Γ`, `Δ`, `Ω` | contexts |
| `Ψ` | the metavariable context, which exists only in Core⁺ |
| `?α`, `?m`, `?r` | metavariables, which exist only in Core⁺ |
| `Int`, `Unit`, `Function`, … | type constructors from `Prim`. These documents write them unqualified for readability; their Core names are fully qualified, as in `Prim.Function` |

`k` and `s` each range over two things, and position tells them apart. A `k` is a kind variable under the binder of a kind scheme and a row key everywhere else; an `s` is a row variable where a row is expected and the symbol of a `SymbolKey` where a key is.

## Sequences

An overbar (combining macron, U+0304) denotes a sequence of zero or more items.

```text
k̄    =  k1, …, kn         a sequence of kind variables
κ̄    =  κ1, …, κn         a sequence of kinds
ā    =  a1, …, an         a sequence of type variables
τ̄, σ̄  =  τ1, …, τn        sequences of types
b̄_i  =  b_i1, …, b_in     an indexed sequence
x̄, ē, v̄                   sequences of value variables, terms, and values
```

`T : forall k̄. κ` reads as `T : forall k1 … kn. κ`. A sequence may be empty, in which case the binder disappears entirely.

## Surface syntax in examples

Examples labelled `purescript` are surface syntax. Examples labelled `text` are Core, or grammar and inference rules. Core is never written by hand in ordinary use; it is the output of elaboration.
